description: "Ramona is an 1884 American novel written by Helen Hunt Jackson. Set\
  \ in Southern California after the Mexican-American War, it portrays the life of\
  \ a mixed-race Scotsâ€“Native American orphan girl, who suffers racial discrimination\
  \ and hardship. Originally serialized in the Christian Union on a weekly basis,\
  \ the novel became immensely popular. It has had more than 300 printings, and been\
  \ adapted four times as a film. A play adaptation has been performed annually outdoors\
  \ since 1923.\nThe novel's influence on the culture and image of Southern California\
  \ was considerable. Its sentimental portrayal of Mexican colonial life contributed\
  \ to establishing a unique cultural identity for the region. As its publication\
  \ coincided with the arrival of railroad lines in the region, countless tourists\
  \ visited who wanted to see the locations of the novel.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC\
